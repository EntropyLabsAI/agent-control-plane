Sentinel is an agent control plane built by [Asteroid](https://asteroid.sh/) that allows you to efficiently oversee thousands of agents running in parallel.

ðŸŽ‰ New: [Inspect](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/) has now made approvals a native feature! Check out the Inspect example [here](examples/inspect_example/README.md).

ðŸš€ Want to see Sentinel in action or chat about agent supervision? [Book a demo with us](https://calendly.com/founders-asteroid/30min)!

We're starting with manual reviews for agent actions, but we'll add ways to automatically approve known safe actions in the future.

## Getting Started

See our docs for examples of how to use Sentinel with any agent[docs](https://docs.asteroid.sh/introduction).

## Examples
We have a number of example containing agents that are using the Sentinel SDK. These are ready to try out of the box:
- [OpenAI](https://docs.asteroid.sh/examples/openai)
- [Inspect](https://docs.asteroid.sh/examples/inspect)
